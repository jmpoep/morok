# Morok

Morok is a modular C++23 LLVM New-PM IR obfuscator. It loads as a pass
plugin inside `clang` or `opt`, rewrites LLVM IR, and emits a behaviorally
equivalent program with fewer stable static landmarks, more hostile control and
data flow, and optional runtime self-protection.

The project is deliberately test-first. Pure arithmetic and encoding
primitives live below LLVM and are exercised by exhaustive/property unit tests.
The LLVM passes are tested as IR emitters and then as a whole pipeline by
compiling and running real C/C++ programs clean vs obfuscated.

Morok is intended for binaries you own or are explicitly authorized to protect
and test. It raises static and dynamic analysis cost; it is not a trust
boundary, a license system by itself, or a substitute for platform signing,
attestation, sandboxing, or server-side policy.

## Scope

Morok can do things an LLVM IR pass can produce:

- Rewrite integer, floating, pointer, stack, PHI, branch, call, string,
  constant, vtable, and VM bytecode IR.
- Emit constructors, helper functions, helper threads, inline assembly,
  signal/exception handlers, direct syscalls, and platform-specific runtime
  probes into the target binary.
- Generate deterministic per-build and per-callsite diversity from a seed.
- Emit post-link manifests for later patching where final native bytes are
  needed, with release gates that scrub retained bypass data after sealing.
- Keep growth bounded with function, module, callsite, table, payload, clone,
  route, and visit caps.

Morok cannot do things that require external infrastructure:

- It cannot sign Mach-O or PE files, provision entitlements, enable HVCI/PPL,
  or turn on compiler/linker features such as CFG/XFG/CET/PAC/BTI/RELRO.
- It cannot provide TPM/SGX/TrustZone/SEV/Secure-Enclave remote roots of trust.
- It cannot make a hostile kernel, debugger, hypervisor, or administrator
  trustworthy.
- It cannot make all platforms equally complete. Some high-intensity runtime
  paths are currently Apple-first and are gated in the test suite elsewhere.

The implementable protection backlog is tracked in
[`docs/insurance-tasks.md`](docs/insurance-tasks.md). Algorithm and pass details
live in [`docs/algorithms.md`](docs/algorithms.md) and
[`docs/hardness.md`](docs/hardness.md).

## Repository Layout

Morok is layered so each level depends strictly downward:

```text
morok::core       Pure algorithms: PRNGs, Feistel, GF(2^8), XOR sharing,
                  MBA/substitution identities, MQ/T-function/Knuth helpers.
                  No LLVM, no I/O.

morok::config     Presets, TOML loading, policy resolution, pass options.
                  No LLVM; demangling is injected.

morok::ir         LLVM helper layer: annotations, symbol cloaking, IR random
                  adapters, shared emit utilities.

morok::runtime    Shared runtime IR emitters for platform primitives such as
                  direct-syscall policy, page protection, file access, and
                  Windows runtime mode selection.

morok::passes     New-PM pass implementations plus testable free functions.

morok_plugin      Loadable New-PM pass plugin, emitted as libMorok.
```

Tracked top-level paths:

```

Optional local paths may exist in a developer tree:

```text
programs/                                         stress corpus for compile/run sweeps
crackmes/                                        example protected programs
issues/                                          local issue triage material
build*/                                          generated build trees
```

## Build Requirements

- CMake 3.28 or newer.
- Ninja.
- A C11 and C++23 capable toolchain.
- LLVM 18 or newer with the New-PM plugin API Morok targets; current vanilla
  LLVM 22/23-style builds are the expected path.

Morok does not require a private LLVM fork. It does require the LLVM headers and
the `clang`/`opt` binaries used at runtime to agree on the same New-PM pass
plugin ABI. The build currently checks for `<llvm/Plugins/PassPlugin.h>` with
`LLVM_PLUGIN_API_VERSION == 2`; older LLVM installs that only expose
`<llvm/Passes/PassPlugin.h>` with API version 1 are a different plugin ABI and
will be rejected by [`cmake/MorokLLVM.cmake`](cmake/MorokLLVM.cmake) instead of
failing later with a cryptic plugin-load error.

The test/build helper defaults to a local LLVM install under `/Users/int/local`.
Override with `CC`, `CXX`, and `LLVM_DIR` when using another matching LLVM.

## Build

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo \
  -DLLVM_DIR="$LLVM_PREFIX/lib/cmake/llvm"
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build -j
```

Useful CMake options:

```text
MOROK_BUILD_TESTS=ON       build tests
MOROK_BUILD_PLUGIN=ON      build libMorok
MOROK_WERROR=OFF           treat warnings as errors when ON
MOROK_SANITIZE=OFF         ASan/UBSan for pure layers/tests when ON
```

Plugin output names:

```text
macOS:   build/src/pipeline/libMorok.dylib
Linux:   build/src/pipeline/libMorok.so
Windows: build/src/pipeline/libMorok.dll
```

On Unix, the plugin is a loadable module that resolves LLVM symbols from the
loading `clang`/`opt` process. On Windows, the plugin statically links the LLVM
component libraries it uses and explicitly exports `llvmGetPassPluginInfo`.

## Authoritative Test Gate

Use the top-level script unless you are intentionally narrowing the loop:

```sh
./run_tests.sh            # incremental configure/build + entire ctest suite
./run_tests.sh --clean    # remove build/ and configure from scratch
./run_tests.sh -R passes  # ctest name regex
./run_tests.sh -L ir      # label filter; labels include core/config/ir/e2e,
                          # security/adversarial/programs/max/linux/threading,
                          # and core/config/ir/unit/aggregate
```

The full gate covers:

| Layer | Test style | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `core` | exhaustive/property doctest suites | arithmetic, field, cipher, PRNG, sharing, and identity primitives are correct independently of LLVM |
| `config` | doctest suites | presets, merge precedence, policy resolution, TOML parsing, and error paths |
| `ir` / `passes` | LLVM-linked IR tests | every pass emits verifier-clean IR and fires on representative shapes |
| whole pipeline | clean-vs-obfuscated differentials | compiled binaries preserve output across presets/configs/seeds |
| build/release hygiene | shell/Python e2e gates | static config layering, entropy-seeded cross-build default, pinned privileged GitHub Actions, release audit policy, and fail-closed unsealed behavior stay enforced |
| `programs/` corpus | compile and runtime sweeps, when present | real C/C++ programs compile at high/max intensity; curated deterministic programs also run byte-for-byte equal |

Platform behavior in the e2e suite:

| Host | E2E behavior |
|---|---|
| Apple | Exercises built-in `high`/`max`, `tests/e2e/max.toml`, VM-specific differential tests, release audit, and adversarial post-link patch/fail-closed tests when Python is available. |
| Non-Apple | Uses `tests/e2e/portable.toml` for high-intensity e2e paths where virtualization and some anti-analysis/mutual-guard runtime paths are not yet fully ported. |
| Windows | Skips behavioral plugin-dlopen e2e tests; coverage comes from core/config/IR tests and targeted object-level checks. |

## Quick Use

Set the plugin path once:

```sh
PLUGIN=build/src/pipeline/libMorok.dylib  # macOS
# PLUGIN=build/src/pipeline/libMorok.so   # Linux
# PLUGIN=build/src/pipeline/libMorok.dll  # Windows
```

Whole pipeline from `clang`:

```sh
clang -O2 -fpass-plugin="$PLUGIN" \
  -mllvm -morok \
  -mllvm -morok-preset=high \
  -mllvm -morok-seed=1234 \
  prog.c -o prog
```

Whole pipeline from `opt`:

```sh
opt -load-pass-plugin "$PLUGIN" \
  -passes=morok prog.ll -o out.bc
```

One standalone pass:

```sh
opt -load-pass-plugin "$PLUGIN" \
  -passes=morok-strenc prog.ll -o out.bc
```

Configuration can be supplied by flag or environment:

```sh
clang -O2 -fpass-plugin="$PLUGIN" \
  -mllvm -morok \
  -mllvm -morok-config=morok.toml \
  -mllvm -morok-seed=0xC0FFEE \
  prog.c -o prog

MOROK_CONFIG=morok.toml \
MOROK_SEED=0xC0FFEE \
clang -O2 -fpass-plugin="$PLUGIN" -mllvm -morok prog.c -o prog
```

Environment switches recognized by the plugin:

```text
MOROK_ENABLE=1                         opt into clang auto-injection without -mllvm -morok
MOROK_CONFIG=path                      config file fallback when -morok-config is absent
MOROK_PRESET=high                      preset fallback when no config file is loaded
MOROK_SEED=1234                        seed fallback when -morok-seed is absent or zero
MOROK_CKD_SEAL_REQUIRED=1              require a post-link CKD seal instead of startup self-seal fallback
MOROK_FAIL_CLOSED_ON_UNSEALED=1        poison seal-dependent paths if retained manifests are still unsealed
MOROK_DISTRIBUTION_SIGNED=1            treat macOS get-task-allow findings as release-signing failures
```

When `-morok-config` or `MOROK_CONFIG` loads successfully, that file supplies
the preset base through `[global].preset`; `-morok-preset` is only used when no
config file is loaded. `-morok-seed` and `MOROK_SEED` override the config seed
for reproducible builds.

The command-line equivalents for the strict release switches are
`-mllvm -morok-ckd-seal-required` and
`-mllvm -morok-fail-closed-on-unsealed`; the macOS distribution-signing
assertion is `-mllvm -morok-distribution-signed`. Only enable strict sealing
switches for builds where the binary will be post-link sealed before first run;
an unsealed strict build is supposed to fail closed rather than silently
self-recover.

For `clang -fpass-plugin`, Morok also registers extension-point callbacks:

- vectorizer-start: early optimizer amplification when enabled.
- pipeline-early-simplification: VM candidate preservation for `-mllvm -morok`.
- optimizer-last: the main Morok scheduler.

## Cross Builds and Post-Link Sealing

The helper in [`cross_build.sh`](cross_build.sh) builds a source file through
Morok for Linux and/or macOS:

```sh
./cross_build.sh --source programs/cf_license_crackme.c --out-dir build/cross
./cross_build.sh --linux-only --source boo.c --out-dir build/cross
./cross_build.sh --macos-arches "arm64 x86_64" --preset max
./cross_build.sh --config morok.toml --seed 832040
```

Common options:

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--source PATH` | Source file to build. A positional source path is also accepted. |
| `--out-dir DIR` | Output directory. |
| `--preset NAME` | Preset to use when `--config` is not supplied. |
| `--config PATH` | TOML config file to use instead of a preset-only build. |
| `--seed N` | Deterministic Morok seed. |
| `--clang PATH`, `--clangxx PATH` | C/C++ compiler drivers matching the plugin LLVM ABI. |
| `--plugin PATH` | Morok plugin path. |
| `--linux-target TRIPLE` | Linux target triple. |
| `--linux-cc PATH` | GCC-compatible Linux cross toolchain driver for crt/libgcc lookup. |
| `--macos-arches LIST` | Space-separated macOS arches or target triples. |
| `--macos-min VERSION` | macOS deployment target. |
| `--linux-only`, `--macos-only` | Build only one platform family. |
| `--no-linux`, `--no-macos` | Skip one platform family. |
| `--no-strip` | Leave produced binaries unstripped. |
| `--no-audit` | Skip the final `morok-audit` release gate. |
| `-h`, `--help` | Show the script help. |

Recognized environment overrides include `BUILD_DIR`, `OUT_DIR`, `CLANG`,
`CLANGXX`, `PLUGIN`, `PRESET`, `SEED`, `OPT_LEVEL`, `LINUX_TARGET`,
`LINUX_CC`, `LINUX_STATIC`, `LINUX_SYSROOT`, `LINUX_STRIP`, `MACOS_ARCHES`,
`MACOS_MIN`, `MACOS_SDK`, `SEAL_BINARIES`, `SEAL_WINDOW`, `SEAL_TOOL`,
`AUDIT_BINARIES`, `AUDIT_TOOL`, `AUDIT_PROVENANCE`, `AUDIT_ALLOWLIST`,
and `PYTHON`.

Important defaults:

```text
source:       programs/cf_license_crackme.c
out dir:      build/cross
preset:       max, unless --config is provided
seed:         0, which means per-build entropy
optimization: -O3
clang:        clang-23
plugin:       build/src/pipeline/libMorok.dylib
Linux target: x86_64-linux-musl
macOS min:    13.0
strip:        enabled
sealing:      enabled
```

For static Linux outputs, `cross_build.sh` derives a temporary TOML config that
forces `[passes.function_call_obfuscate].enabled = false` and sets
`[passes.platform_runtime].static_link_expected = true`. A fully static binary
has no dynamic loader, so dynamic import lookup has no useful hiding surface and
can crash if left enabled. The static-link flag also enables the Linux `AT_BASE`
tripwire, which folds a dynamic-loader mapping into the runtime seal only for
builds that are expected to be `-static`; ordinary dynamic outputs must leave it
off.

Post-link sealing is mandatory for shippable binaries that rely on
`self_checksum_constants`, `mutual_guard_graph`, or `caller_keyed_dispatch`
native-code windows. The IR passes reserve retained manifests, but final code
byte ranges are only known after linking and stripping. `cross_build.sh` seals
automatically after strip and fails closed if no manifests are present. The
post-link sealer uses the requested `--window` as the native-code hash coverage
limit; the self-check random-data `region_bytes` setting does not cap code
coverage. It then runs `tools/morok-audit.py` over the final output directory to
reject unsealed manifests, placeholder manifest state, private-key sidecars,
embedded development paths, plaintext high-value release markers, and plaintext
magic/sentinel markers before anything is shipped.

When macOS sealing is enabled, `cross_build.sh` also passes the strict seal
flags (`-morok-ckd-seal-required` and
`-morok-fail-closed-on-unsealed`) before the post-link seal/re-sign step. Linux
outputs are still sealed and audited by default, but the helper leaves those
strict plugin flags off for the Linux compile path; add them only in a pipeline
that has proven its Linux sealing step is mandatory and runs before the binary
can execute.

Manual sealing is:

```sh
python3 tests/e2e/adversarial_binary.py seal path/to/binary --window 262144
```

On macOS, an in-place seal invalidates the ad hoc signature, so the helper
re-signs the binary after patching.

Manual release audit is:

```sh
python3 tools/morok-audit.py build/cross --release --require-sealed-manifest \
  --provenance build/cross/morok-audit.json
```

The audit verifies self-check, mutual-guard, and caller-keyed-dispatch post-link
records, then writes a provenance manifest with file hashes, detected binary
formats, sealed-manifest counts, and any findings. Release findings are hard
failures. Test fixtures must be allowlisted explicitly with a versioned JSON
file:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "allow": [
    {"path": "fixtures/*.pem", "checks": ["private-key-sidecar"]}
  ]
}
```

## Configuration Model

Config layering is intentionally simple:

1. `[global].preset` loads `low`, `mid`, `high`, `max`, or `none`.
2. `[passes.*]` sections override only fields they mention.
3. Ordered `[[policy]]` rules can apply another preset and/or pass overrides to
   matching module/function regexes.
4. `-mllvm -morok-seed=N` or `MOROK_SEED=N` overrides the config seed for
   deterministic builds.

Top-level global keys:

```toml
[global]
preset = "high"
seed = 0xDEADBEEF1337
verbose = false
trace = false
demangle_names = true
```

Example:

```toml
[global]
preset = "high"
seed = 0xDEADBEEF1337
demangle_names = true

[passes.string_encryption]
enabled = true
probability = 100
skip_content = ["Usage:"]

[passes.function_call_obfuscate]
enabled = true

[passes.windows_process_mitigations]
enabled = true

[[policy]]
function = "^main$"
passes.bcf.enabled = false
passes.substitution.enabled = false

[[policy]]
function = "license|verify|decrypt"
passes.mba.enabled = true
passes.external_opaque_predicates.enabled = true
passes.virtualization.enabled = true
```

Policies are evaluated in file order by
[`src/config/Resolver.cpp`](src/config/Resolver.cpp). Regexes match the module
source filename and/or function name. If `demangle_names = true`, policy
function matching uses demangled names where possible.

## Presets

| Preset | Intent |
|---|---|
| `none` | No preset base. Only explicitly enabled pass sections or policies apply. |
| `low` | Light scalar/control rewriting, string encryption, constant sharing, split blocks, and retained decoy strings. |
| `mid` | Broader scalar/control obfuscation with more density and vector/table features than `low`. |
| `high` | Bounded aggressive mode: capped VM/self-decrypt/integrity/table/MQ/microstress/function-wrapper slices while keeping expensive graph-wide searches controlled. Fault-paged payload knobs are preset but opt-in while the portable backend is `lazy_accessor`. |
| `max` | Full preset-managed stack: high probabilities, maximal tested budgets, anti-debug/anti-hook/timing/trap bundle, FCO, VM, self-decrypt, integrity, routing, wrappers, Windows pass toggles, and decoys. Fault-paged payload delivery remains opt-in until an OS-backed backend meets the max runtime gate. |

The scheduler enforces instruction, block, function, module, byte, table,
route, callsite, clone, payload, and visit caps. If a function or module grows
beyond the relevant budget, later growth passes are skipped rather than
allowing unbounded IR expansion.

## Annotations

Source annotations are copied from Clang's `llvm.global.annotations` into Morok
metadata before scheduling:

```c
__attribute__((annotate("sub")))       static int force_sub(int x) { return x + 1; }
__attribute__((annotate("nosub")))     static int skip_sub(int x)  { return x + 1; }
__attribute__((annotate("sensitive"))) static int hot_secret(int x) { return x * 7; }
```

Per-function annotation keys are the scheduler tags:

```text
aliasop, bcf, csm, constenc, decoy, dfi, dispatchless, entfla, extop,
fla, ifsm, indibran, mba, microstress, mq, mutualguard, nistate, optamp,
pathexplode, phitangle, ptrlaunder, selfcheck, shamir, split,
stackcoalesce, stackdelta, stateop, sub, tablearith, threshold, tracekey,
typepun, uniform, vobf
```

Prefix any key with `no` to force that pass off for a function, for example
`nomba`, `nobcf`, or `noconstenc`.

`sensitive` is special: when BCF, MBA, or external opaque predicates are unset
or enabled, the scheduler raises their density on that function. Explicit
negative annotations still win.

## Scheduler Order

The whole-pipeline `morok` pass is ordered to preserve semantics and maximize
composition:

```text
VM(user code)
-> fault-paged VM payload delivery
-> hash-gated VM self-decrypt for remaining eager payloads
-> anti-hook / anti-class-dump / Windows substrate and Windows probes
-> anti-debug / timing / scheduler-step / trap / page-fault / cache / microarchitectural probes
-> decoy strings
-> string encryption
-> function-call obfuscation
-> vtable integrity
-> per-function structural, scalar, CFG, data-flow, integrity, and literal passes
-> leaf-helper seal binding
-> VM/hardening for generated protection helpers
-> nanomites
-> adversarial self-tuning / merge
-> caller-keyed dispatch
-> function wrappers
-> per-build polymorphism
-> misleading metadata
-> generated-symbol privacy cleanup
```

Within the per-function loop, Morok runs structural and value-level transforms
before routing/integrity/literal hiding:

```text
de-switch wide gate constants
-> split
-> BCF
-> optimizer amplification
-> substitution
-> MBA
-> sub-threshold persistence
-> alias/external opaque predicates
-> coherent decoys
-> exactly one flattening family member: NiState / EntFla / CSM / Flatten
-> state opaque predicates
-> interprocedural FSM
-> PHI tangling
-> type punning
-> stack coalescing
-> stack delta games
-> pointer laundering
-> DFI
-> table arithmetic
-> uniform primitive lowering
-> vector obfuscation
-> path explosion
-> MQ gates
-> trace keying
-> dispatcherless routing
-> microcode stress
-> self-checksum constants
-> mutual guard graph
-> Shamir sharing
-> constant encryption
-> condition-only constant encryption rescue
-> indirect branch
```

The precise maintained order is documented in
[`docs/algorithms.md`](docs/algorithms.md#scheduler-order-to-preserve-semantics).

## Pass Inventory

Each pass can be run standalone with `-passes=morok-*` where the plugin registers
that name, or through the scheduler with a TOML section. Rows marked
`scheduler-only` have config support but no current plugin parsing callback.
Some final hygiene transforms, such as misleading metadata, leaf-helper seal
binding, protection-helper hardening, and private-linkage cleanup for generated
`morok.*` helpers, are scheduler-only.

### Structural, Control-Flow, and Decompiler Stress

| Capability | `-passes` name | TOML section | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|
| Split basic blocks | `morok-split` | `split_blocks` | Splits blocks into more dispatch targets. |
| Function fission | scheduler-only | `function_fission` | Outlines single-entry/single-exit regions of a function into fresh internal `morok.fission.*` callees (via `CodeExtractor`), so the source function boundaries no longer match the binary and the call graph fans out. Shrinking the originals also brings oversized functions back under the per-function obfuscation/integrity budgets so the seal-binding passes can reach them. Parts are marked `noinline`; EH/`setjmp`/varargs/computed-goto functions are skipped. |
| Bogus control flow | `morok-bcf` | `bcf` | Adds opaque-true guarded junk/decoy edges with optional entropy and inline-asm pressure. |
| Flattening | `morok-flatten` | `flattening` | Classic switch-dispatcher control-flow flattening. |
| Data-entangled flattening | `morok-entfla` | `data_entangled_flattening` | Stores successor state through live-data and previous-state tokens. |
| Non-invertible state | `morok-nistate` | `non_invertible_state` | Uses keyed lossy hashes for encoded dispatcher states. |
| Stateful opaque predicates | `morok-stateop` | `state_opaque_predicates` | Places opaque guards over flattened state plus scalar live terms. |
| Interprocedural FSM | `morok-ifsm` | `interprocedural_fsm` | Routes flattened state transitions through mutually-recursive helper calls. |
| Chaos state machine | `morok-csm` | `chaos_state_machine` | Flattens through logistic-map or T-function state evolution. |
| T-function flattening | `morok-tfa` | `chaos_state_machine` | Convenience standalone CSM variant using a single-cycle T-function generator. |
| Dispatcherless routing | `morok-dispatchless` | `dispatcherless_routing` | Replaces direct branch/switch edges with state-entangled `indirectbr` DAGs. |
| Indirect branch | `morok-indbr` | `indirect_branch` | Lowers surviving conditional/switch edges through randomized `indirectbr` tables. |
| Microcode stress | `morok-microstress` | `microcode_stress` | Emits oversized blockaddress tables and aliased decoy destinations. |
| Path explosion | `morok-pathexplode` | `path_explosion` | Adds opaque-guarded input-derived decoy loops and volatile symbolic stores. |
| Coherent decoys | `morok-decoy` | `coherent_decoys` | Adds plausible dead alternate return computations and hidden decoy-tamper state. |
| Alias opaque predicates | `morok-aliasop` | `alias_opaque_predicates` | Maintains pointer/alias invariants that guard decoy edges. |
| External opaque predicates | `morok-extop` | `external_opaque_predicates` | Uses IPO-blocked volatile helper guards and scratch decoy arms. |
| MQ gate | `morok-mq` | `mq_gate` | Plants GF(2) quadratic opaque gates over argument-derived bits. |
| Nanomites | `morok-nanomites` | `nanomites` | Replaces selected branches with trap-mediated encrypted target lookup on supported POSIX triples. |
| Adversarial merge/outline | `morok-afm` | `adversarial_function_merging` | Merges same-signature functions behind selector dispatchers and outlines scalar fragments. |
| Adversarial self-tuning | `morok-selftune` | `adversarial_self_tuning` | Scores cloned candidate bundles and replays the strongest verifier-clean bundle. |
| Per-build polymorphism | `morok-polymorph` | `per_build_polymorphism` | Reorders functions/blocks and adds neutral volatile return anchors from the seed. |

### Scalar, Data-Flow, Stack, and Literal Obfuscation

| Capability | `-passes` name | TOML section | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|
| Instruction substitution | `morok-substitution` | `substitution` | Rewrites integer ops into equivalent expression trees. |
| Mixed Boolean-Arithmetic | `morok-mba` | `mba` | Layers MBA identities and zero-noise terms. |
| Optimizer amplification | `morok-optamp` | `optimizer_amplification` | Emits input-selected equivalent forms before optimizer lowering. |
| Sub-threshold persistence | `morok-threshold` | `sub_threshold_persistence` | Adds volatile local-seed opaque-zero terms below fold thresholds. |
| Constant encryption | `morok-constenc` | `constant_encryption` | Reconstructs literals from volatile XOR shares and optional Feistel/sharing layers. |
| Shamir threshold sharing | `morok-shamir` | `shamir_share` | Reconstructs selected scalar literals from volatile GF(2^8) threshold shares. |
| Table arithmetic | `morok-tablearith` | `table_arithmetic` | Lowers narrow/const-indexed ops to encrypted lazy lookup tables. |
| Uniform primitive lowering | `morok-uniform` | `uniform_primitive_lowering` | Table-lowers byte ops and selected branches into memory-loaded dispatch. |
| Vector obfuscation | `morok-vec` | `vector_obfuscation` | Lifts scalar ops/casts/comparisons/selects into SIMD lanes. |
| Stack coalescing | `morok-stackcoalesce` | `stack_coalescing` | Collapses static allocas into one opaque byte buffer. |
| Stack delta games | `morok-stackdelta` | `stack_delta_games` | Adds dynamic stack-pointer deltas and overlapping volatile stack touches. |
| Pointer laundering | `morok-ptrlaunder` | `pointer_laundering` | Sends pointers/scalars through pointer-int and byte-vector boundaries. |
| Type punning | `morok-typepun` | `type_punning` | Round-trips scalars through volatile union-buffer reinterpretation chains. |
| PHI tangling | `morok-phitangle` | `phi_tangling` | Builds redundant scalar PHI webs and cross-edge value copies. |

### Strings, Imports, Calls, and C++ Dispatch

| Capability | `-passes` name | TOML section | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|
| String encryption | `morok-strenc` | `string_encryption` | Encrypts eligible private byte-array globals with a unique per-string cipher. Safe C-string callsites are materialized into per-use stack buffers; unsupported uses get per-string constructor decryptors. |
| Sealed blobs | `morok-sealedblob` | `sealed_blob` | Encrypts explicit `.morok.sealed` byte-array globals and rewrites supported reads through per-blob lazy accessors keyed by RuntimeSeal/external-proof material, with optional runtime-keyed magic-prefix diagnostics. |
| Function-call obfuscation | `morok-fco` | `function_call_obfuscate` | Hides external calls behind per-site import indirection. Linux/macOS 64-bit paths use manual export-by-hash resolvers where supported; unsupported targets use per-site cloaked dynamic lookup. |
| Caller-keyed dispatch | `morok-ckd` | `caller_keyed_dispatch` | Collapses surviving direct user calls through native dispatch hubs keyed by caller context and post-link sealed integrity bytes. With `carriers > 1` the indirect jump rotates across distinct callee-saved carrier registers (per-register dispatchers `br x19`/`br x21`/…), so the control transfer at each site looks bespoke. |
| Returnless dispatch | scheduler-only | `returnless_dispatch` | Rewrites tail-position returns (`return f(...)`) into indirect tail branches: the function leaves through a computed `br x16` / `jmp *rax` read from a hidden slot instead of a `ret`, and the callee target is no longer a direct edge. Perfect-forwarding sites use `musttail` (guaranteed no `ret`); others use a `tail` hint. Only genuine tail-position returns qualify — returns of computed values keep a normal ABI return, and escaping/EH/`setjmp`/varargs/`sret`/`byval` sites are skipped. Off by default; opt-in while validated per platform. |
| Function wrapper | `morok-funcwrap` | `function_wrapper` | Wraps calls after per-function transforms so callers see proxy edges. |
| VTable integrity | `morok-vtable` | `vtable_integrity` | Guards Itanium C++ virtual dispatches by expected vptr, slot, target, and cookie hash. |
| Decoy strings | `morok-decoystr` | `decoy_strings` | Distributes retained plaintext honeypot diagnostics and fake logging infrastructure. |

String encryption intentionally excludes generated `morok.decoy.str.*` globals.
Those decoys must remain visible to cheap triage tools such as `strings`; real
user strings are encrypted, length-padded where safe, and materialized lazily.
Sealed blobs are opt-in: mark a private byte-array global with section
`.morok.sealed` or a `morok.sealed.` prefix. Supported load/no-capture call
uses materialize into per-use stack buffers via a per-blob `morok.sealed.open.*`
helper, then volatile-zero the temporary buffer when configured.
With `runtime_keyed_magic=true`, each generated accessor derives a per-blob
prefix tag from the anti-debug RuntimeSeal channel and the blob id, compares it
against the materialized plaintext prefix without early exit, and stores only an
opaque volatile diagnostic word. The compare is not the primary access gate and
does not require a plaintext sentinel to survive in `.rodata`.

### Virtualization and Integrity Entanglement

| Capability | `-passes` name | TOML section | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|
| Virtualization | `morok-vm` | `virtualization` | Lifts eligible integer/pointer computation kernels to encrypted threaded bytecode VMs, including multi-block, memory, cast, compare, division, selected intrinsics, and direct internal helper calls when safe. |
| Fault-paged payload delivery | `morok-fpp` | `fault_paged_payload` | Encrypts VM bytecode per page and replaces direct bytecode loads with a lazy accessor that decrypts one page-local cache at a time, re-clears page state on switches, and binds anomalous access to the `fault_paged_payload` runtime seal channel. |
| Hash-gated self-decrypt | `morok-selfdecrypt` | `hash_gated_self_decrypt` | Lazily decrypts VM bytecode from runtime hashes/context and re-encrypts on helper exit. |
| External proof binding | `morok-proofbind` | `external_secret_binding` | Materializes a proof feed/finish API and folds the proof digest difference into the `external_proof` runtime seal channel, so only the expected proof keeps the clean key state. |
| Environment binding KDF | `morok-envbind` | `env_binding_kdf` | Collects enrolled host identity material, folds mismatches into the `env_binding` runtime seal channel, and feeds string, sealed-blob, and VM key schedules. |
| Tracer attestation | `morok-tracer` | `tracer_attestation` | Uses a Linux/x86_64 buddy tracer to inject runtime-only share words into the parent and folds only delivery mismatch deltas into the `tracer` and anti-debug runtime seal channels. |
| Self-checksum constants | `morok-selfcheck` | `self_checksum_constants` | Fuses constants with runtime checksum diffs so tamper corrupts data instead of branching. |
| Mutual guard graph | `morok-mutualguard` | `mutual_guard_graph` | Emits overlapping checksum nodes whose aggregate diff poisons scalar returns. |
| Data-flow integrity | `morok-dfi` | `data_flow_integrity` | Decodes narrow op tables from runtime integrity hashes and decoy hidden state. |
| Execution-trace keying | `morok-tracekey` | `execution_trace_keying` | Carries a rolling trace accumulator and delayed tamper samples through data/control state. |

For `external_secret_binding`, `expected_digest` is the expected 64-bit final
proof accumulator accepted by `morok.proof.finish`. If it is omitted or invalid,
the pass uses a per-build random expected value so arbitrary proof presence fails
closed instead of keeping the clean seal state.

VM dispatch is total over all 256 decoded handler IDs. Invalid decoded opcodes,
registers, pointer-table indexes, branch targets, and unsafe div/rem operands
are folded into a local poison accumulator and canonicalized to in-bounds state
instead of trapping or indexing out of range. A guarded per-PC opcode check also
poisons valid-but-wrong handler IDs, so a wrong key cannot cleanly land on
another real handler. Fault-paged payload delivery is
preferred for configured VM payloads and leaves already protected bytecode
mutable, so hash-gated self-decrypt only wraps remaining eager payloads. It does
not allocate a full-payload plaintext scratch buffer; the accessor decrypts the
requested page into a fixed-size cache and clears it before another page is
materialized. Hash-gated self-decrypt follows the same release-mode policy: a
failed payload hash poisons the bytecode and publishes it as ready so tamper
surfaces as wrong VM output, not a fixed `llvm.trap` oracle.

The scheduler runs a second, restricted VM/hardening stage over allowlisted
generated protection helpers so anti-debug, anti-hook, decryptor, and integrity
logic is not left as a simple native plaintext island.

| Page-fault/TLB oracle | `morok-pftlb` | `page_fault_oracles` | Maps protected code islands, validates fault provenance, and folds missing/extra/slow faults into state. |
| Cache-timing oracle | `morok-cachetime` | `cache_timing_oracles` | Pseudo-random pointer chase over code bytes with clock distribution checks. |
| Microarchitectural canary | `morok-microcanary` | `microarchitectural_canaries` | Samples branch-prediction/speculation side effects as low-confidence timing evidence. |
| Misleading metadata | scheduler-only | automatic | Plants retained fake local symbols, aliases, and contradictory-but-valid debug metadata, then hides generated helper symbols with private linkage. |

### Windows x86_64 Passes

The Windows passes are opt-in module passes. They share the Windows PE
foundation helpers instead of hardcoding duplicate offsets or import paths.

| Capability | `-passes` name | TOML section | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|
| PE foundation | `morok-winpe` | `windows_pe_foundation` | Emits GS-relative TEB/PEB readers, PE header/export-by-hash resolver, syscall-stub scanner, direct/indirect syscall thunks, and VEH registration substrate. |

| Process mitigations | `morok-winmitigate` | `windows_process_mitigations` | Hash-resolves `SetProcessMitigationPolicy` and opts into ACG/CIG after Morok's startup text repair. |

## TOML Option Reference

Every per-pass field is optional. Unset fields fall through to the preset,
policy, or pass default. Percentages use `0..100` unless noted.

### Global and Policy

| Scope | Keys |
|---|---|
| `[global]` | `preset`, `seed`, `verbose`, `trace`, `demangle_names` |
| `[passes]` | `fail_closed_on_unsealed` plus nested pass sections |
| `[[policy]]` | `module`, `function`, `preset`, nested `passes.<section>.<key>` overrides |

`fail_closed_on_unsealed` is a cross-pass release switch. When enabled, runtime
paths that depend on post-link manifests fail closed if a binary still contains
unsealed manifest sentinels instead of sealed code-window metadata.

### Anti-Analysis and Platform Toggle Sections

These sections currently accept only `enabled`:

```text
anti_hooking
anti_class_dump
windows_pe_foundation
windows_peb_heap_debug
windows_debug_object
windows_thread_hide
windows_anti_attach
windows_kernel_debugger
windows_syscalls
windows_process_modules
windows_unhook
windows_veh_audit
windows_process_mitigations
timing_oracles
scheduler_step_oracles
trap_oracles
page_fault_oracles
cache_timing_oracles
microarchitectural_canaries
```

`anti_debugging` accepts `enabled` and `distribution_signed`. The
`distribution_signed` key is also forced by `-mllvm -morok-distribution-signed`
or `MOROK_DISTRIBUTION_SIGNED=1`.

`platform_runtime` accepts `enabled`, `direct_syscalls` (`auto`, `always`,
`never`), `windows_mode` (`documented_api`, `hashed_import`, `direct_syscall`),
`per_build_stubs`, `minimize_imports`, `import_table_audit`, and
`static_link_expected`. The runtime is an internal emitter layer; these fields
document and preset the platform policy used by anti-analysis producers rather
than adding a standalone `-passes` entry.

## Platform Notes

- macOS arm64/x86_64: primary full-pipeline e2e target. The Apple test path
  exercises the full `high`/`max` presets, VM-specific tests, and adversarial
  post-link patch tests when Python is available.
- Linux x86_64: supported for core/config/IR and portable e2e gates. Static
  cross-builds disable FCO automatically unless an explicit config chooses
  otherwise.
- Linux arm64 and other non-Apple hosts: use the portable e2e configuration for
  high-intensity runtime tests until the VM/trap/anti-analysis runtime paths are
  fully ported.
- Windows x86_64: Windows-specific passes emit PE/PEB/TEB/export/syscall/VEH
  helpers into Windows-targeted IR. Behavioral e2e plugin loading is skipped on
  Windows hosts; coverage comes from core/config/IR tests and targeted object
  smokes.
- Unsupported triples keep conservative fallbacks or no-op for passes that need
  platform-specific context layouts.

## Static-Recovery Resistance Notes

The current string/import strategy is designed against simple static decoders:

- Real private byte-array strings do not share a global decryptor. Safe C-string
  uses get per-use stack materialization; unsupported uses get one private
  constructor per string.
- Each string has independent key material, keystream variant, ADD/XOR combine,
  and odd multiplier, all perturbed through volatile runtime state.
- Linux/macOS FCO avoids plaintext symbol strings for supported 64-bit manual
  resolver paths and otherwise falls back conservatively.
- Per-callsite cached function pointers are encoded with volatile seed/key
  material and exist as raw pointers only immediately before the indirect call.
- Caller-keyed dispatch, function wrappers, adversarial merge/outline, and
  per-build polymorphism reduce stable caller/callee shape across builds.
- Decoy strings are retained and plaintext by design, so `strings` should find
  bait while real user strings remain hidden.
- Generated `morok.*` helpers are demoted to private linkage at the end of the
  scheduler so descriptive helper names do not reach the object symbol table.

## FAQ

The detailed objection handling is in
[`docs/objections.md`](docs/objections.md). This section keeps the public claim
short.

**What does Morok actually claim to buy?**

Morok is meant to make cheap static recovery unattractive: `strings`, import
walks, direct call graphs, ordinary switch/branch recovery, bulk IR lifting, and
one-pass decompiler cleanup should stop giving a clean map of the protected
program. The target is attacker cost, not permanent secrecy.

**What does it not claim to beat?**

A debugger, DBI trace, emulator, or hostile kernel that reaches the right runtime
context can observe concrete state. If plaintext bytes, a decoded VM stream, a
resolved function pointer, or a reconstructed secret exists in process memory,
then a sufficiently placed dynamic trace can see it. Morok can shorten windows,
bind values to runtime checks, and make the analyst work for the trigger
condition; it cannot remove the basic man-at-the-end limit.

**Will IDA, Ghidra, or Binary Ninja still produce something useful?**

Yes. A decompiler will always produce something. The question is whether the
output is good enough for fast triage: stable strings, obvious imports,
recoverable caller/callee relationships, clean dispatchers, readable arithmetic,
and obvious authorization gates. Morok tries to damage those landmarks. It does
not make the original semantics mathematically unrecoverable.

**Are MBA rewrites and opaque predicates the security boundary?**

No. Treat them as noise and pressure, not load-bearing protection. MBA identities
and many opaque predicates are known deobfuscator targets. Their job is to add
surface area and force proof work around stronger mechanisms such as per-site
string recovery, function-call obfuscation, indirect routing, VM transforms, and
sealed runtime state.

**Are strings and imports supposed to be invisible?**

Real protected strings should not sit in the binary as plaintext or flow through
one global decryptor. Supported call sites use per-site materialization, and
function pointers are resolved and cached per call site. Fallback paths exist,
platform support differs, and decoy strings are intentionally left readable. A
release build should be checked with normal static tooling before it is trusted.

**Does virtualization or self-decryption stop dynamic reversing?**

No. It changes the job from "read the original function" to "recover the executed
semantics or the decoded stream." That can be much more expensive, especially
when runtime seals and trigger conditions are involved, but it is still a
recoverable dynamic-analysis problem.

**Does open source make the project pointless?**

No, but it removes any excuse for relying on hidden transform templates. Assume
the attacker has read every pass. The only secrets that matter are per-build
seeded choices, runtime-gated values, and deployment-specific state. Source
availability also tells a dynamic attacker where to look, so claims must be
tested on binaries, not argued from source shape.

**What is the release bar?**

Run the full test gate, then inspect the binary as an attacker would: `strings`,
`nm`/`otool`/`objdump`, decompiler output, import tables, runtime traces for
gated paths, and post-link seal state when those features are enabled. If a
protected build still exposes clear strings, direct sensitive imports, or a
plain authorization path, treat that as a failed configuration or a bug.

## Development Workflow

For a narrow pass edit, use the smallest focused tests first:

```sh
cmake --build build --target morok_ir_tests morok_config_tests morok_plugin
./build/tests/ir/morok_ir_tests
./build/tests/unit/config/morok_config_tests
```

For core/config edits:

```sh
cmake --build build --target morok_core_tests morok_config_tests
./build/tests/unit/core/morok_core_tests
./build/tests/unit/config/morok_config_tests
```

Before merging or pushing a completed code feature, run:

```sh
./run_tests.sh
git diff --check
```

When touching platform runtime emitters, add a targeted object/binary smoke that
proves the relevant strings/symbols are absent where expected and that the
emitted object contains the expected constructor/helper shape.

When touching post-link integrity, verify both halves:

```sh
./run_tests.sh -L adversarial
python3 tests/e2e/adversarial_binary.py seal path/to/binary --window 262144
```

The default seal command must cover the full requested native-code window. Do
not use `region_bytes` as a code-window cap; it sizes only the synthetic
self-check data region.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| CMake cannot find `llvm/Plugins/PassPlugin.h` | Host LLVM is upstream or wrong fork/API | Point `LLVM_DIR` at the matching custom LLVM install. |
| Plugin load reports API/version mismatch | `clang`/`opt` and Morok were built against different LLVM plugin ABIs | Rebuild Morok with the same LLVM used by the host driver. |
| `-mllvm -morok` is unknown on Windows | Windows plugin cl::opts are not parsed by host clang the same way | Use `MOROK_ENABLE=1` plus `MOROK_CONFIG`, `MOROK_PRESET`, and `MOROK_SEED`. |
| Static Linux binary crashes around import indirection | FCO was left enabled in a static link | Use `cross_build.sh` or force `[passes.function_call_obfuscate].enabled = false` and `[passes.platform_runtime].static_link_expected = true`. |
| Self-checksum does not detect a native patch | Post-link manifests were not sealed | Seal after final link/strip and run `tools/morok-audit.py --release --require-sealed-manifest`. |
| E2E max fails off Apple | Some max-level runtime/backend paths are still Apple-first | Use `tests/e2e/portable.toml` and consult the comments in that file. |
| A huge input stops getting later transforms | Scheduler growth budgets are firing | Narrow with policy/annotations or increase the specific pass budget after adding tests. |
