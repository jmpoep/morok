# Morok

A modular, layered, test-first C++23 LLVM-IR obfuscator. Morok is a New-PM pass
plugin: it rewrites a module's IR into a behaviourally-identical but
harder-to-analyse form.

---

## Why this layout

The codebase is split into layers that depend strictly downward, so each can be
built and tested in isolation. The lower two layers have **no LLVM dependency**
at all and are verified by fast, exhaustive unit tests; only the upper layers
touch LLVM.

```
  morok::core      pure algorithms — PRNG, GF(2^8), Feistel, XOR sharing,
                   MBA & substitution identities, chaos map, Knuth hash.
                   Header-only, constexpr, zero LLVM, zero I/O.
        ▲
  morok::config    preset / policy / TOML configuration model + resolver.
                   Pure; name demangling injected so it needs no LLVM.
        ▲
  morok::ir        LLVM-IR helpers: annotations, PRNG↔IR adaptor.
        ▲
  morok::passes    the transformations (New-PM passes + testable free fns).
        ▲
  libMorok         the loadable pass plugin: scheduler + plugin entry point.
```

The guiding principle: **the security-critical math is proven once, in the pure
core, independently of any IR.** A pass then only has to *emit* the matching IR,
and the end-to-end differential tests confirm it did so without changing
behaviour.

```

## Building

Requires a C++23 compiler, CMake ≥ 3.28, Ninja, and an LLVM that exposes the
New-PM plugin API. See [`cmake/MorokLLVM.cmake`](cmake/MorokLLVM.cmake) for the
exact validation performed at configure time.

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DLLVM_DIR="$LLVM_PREFIX/lib/cmake/llvm"
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build -j
```

Or run the whole thing — build plus the *entire* suite (core logic / property
tests, config tests, the LLVM-linked per-pass IR tests, the `c -> clang
--morok--> binary` differential tests, and the full `programs/` compile sweep at
`high` and `max` settings) — with the single top-level entrypoint:

```sh
./run_tests.sh            # incremental build + everything
./run_tests.sh --clean    # wipe build/ and reconfigure first
./run_tests.sh -L ir      # just one label (core/config/ir/e2e/programs/max)
```

The pure layers (`morok::core`, `morok::config`) and their tests build even if
no usable LLVM is found; the IR/plugin layers are skipped in that case.

## Using the plugin

```sh
# Whole pipeline, driven by a preset:
clang -O2 -fpass-plugin=build/src/pipeline/libMorok.dylib \
      -mllvm -morok -mllvm -morok-preset=high -mllvm -morok-seed=1234 prog.c -o prog

# Or via opt on IR:
opt -load-pass-plugin build/src/pipeline/libMorok.dylib -passes=morok prog.ll -o out.ll

# Individual passes:
opt -load-pass-plugin … -passes=morok-substitution …
opt -load-pass-plugin … -passes=morok-mba …
opt -load-pass-plugin … -passes=morok-constenc …
```

Configuration can also come from a TOML file (`-morok-config=…`, `MOROK_CONFIG`),
with `[global]`, `[passes.*]`, and ordered `[[policy]]` rules; see
[`docs/algorithms.md`](docs/algorithms.md) and the config tests for the schema.
Per-function `__attribute__((annotate("sub")))` / `annotate("nosub")` overrides
are honoured.

The scheduler has hard instruction/block/module budgets and skips growth passes
once a function or module is too large.  The `high` preset is bounded-aggressive:
it enables small capped slices of VM lifting, hash self-decrypt, DFI,
self-checks, MQ, microcode stress, and call-site wrapping while keeping
adversarial clone/merge tuning as explicit opt-ins.  The `max` preset turns
*everything* on — every pass enabled, every probability at 100, every budget at
its proven ceiling (including mutual-guard, adversarial merge/outline and
self-tuning, plain flattening, and the runtime anti-analysis trio) — and is the
strongest configuration the whole sample corpus still compiles under.  String
encryption also has
direct byte caps so large global literals do not expand into unbounded
constructor IR.  Standalone growth-heavy passes have fixed local caps for table,
CFG-route, and call-site collection.

## Testing strategy

Coverage is layered to match the architecture:

| Layer            | Test kind                      | What it proves |
|------------------|--------------------------------|----------------|
| `core`           | exhaustive / property unit tests | every PRNG, field, cipher, and rewrite **identity** is mathematically correct (≈1.4×10⁸ assertions, e.g. all 65 536 8-bit operand pairs × every MBA/substitution variant) |
| `config`         | unit tests                     | preset tables, merge precedence, policy resolution order, TOML parsing & errors |
| `ir` / `passes`  | LLVM-linked IR tests           | each pass emits **well-formed IR** (`verifyModule`) and actually fires |
| whole stack      | e2e differential tests         | obfuscated binaries produce **identical output** to clean ones across presets/seeds |

`ctest` exposes each test module as its own entry (e.g. `ctest -R core/galois8`)
and runs them in parallel.

## Passes

Every obfuscation pass is implemented as a New-PM pass, each available standalone
(`-passes=morok-<name>`) and orchestrated by the scheduler (`-passes=morok`, or
`-morok` + a preset):

| Pass | `-passes` name | What it does |

| Substitution | `morok-substitution` | integer ops → equivalent expression trees |
| Mixed Boolean-Arithmetic | `morok-mba` | layered MBA rewrites + zero-noise |
| Sub-threshold persistence | `morok-threshold` | volatile-seeded neutral terms tuned below optimizer fold thresholds |
| Flattening | `morok-flatten` | switch-dispatcher control-flow flattening |
| Data-entangled flattening | `morok-entfla` | dispatcher state updates fused with live data |
| Non-invertible state | `morok-nistate` | flattened next states hashed into encoded dispatcher IDs |
| Stateful opaque predicates | `morok-stateop` | MBA opaque guards over flattened dispatcher state |
| Interprocedural FSM | `morok-ifsm` | flattened state updates routed through recursive helper functions |
| Chaos state machine | `morok-csm` | flattening driven by logistic or T-function state maps |
| T-function flattening | `morok-tfa` | single-cycle nonlinear dispatcher-state generator |
| Dispatcherless routing | `morok-dispatchless` | branch/switch edges → state-entangled `indirectbr` DAG |
| Microcode stress | `morok-microstress` | oversized computed blockaddress tables with aliased decoy destinations |
| Vector obfuscation | `morok-vec` | scalar ops/casts/comparisons/selects lifted to configurable SIMD |
| Self-checksum constants | `morok-selfcheck` | constants fused with runtime checksum diff so tamper corrupts data |

| Indirect branch | `morok-indbr` | conditional/switch edges → randomized `indirectbr` table |
| Function wrapper | `morok-funcwrap` | call/invoke sites, including variadic, routed through forwarder proxies |
| Function-call obfuscate | `morok-fco` | external calls/invokes resolved via `dlsym`, the symbol name decrypted inline per-site (never a readable string) |
| Anti-debugging | `morok-antidbg` | `ptrace`-based debugger denial at startup |
| Anti-hooking | `morok-antihook` | startup check for resident hooking frameworks |
| Anti-class-dump | `morok-antiacd` | scrambles Objective-C metadata (no-op without it) |

Every pass is exercised by an IR-validity test, and the value/control-flow
passes are additionally proven semantics-preserving by the end-to-end
differential tests across the `low`/`mid`/`high`/`max` presets.  The `max`
preset stacks every pass at full intensity and still reproduces the reference
output byte-for-byte, and the entire `programs/` corpus compiles under it.

Faithfulness note for the current LLVM: indirect-branch keys the table index
rather than multiplicatively encrypting the loaded pointer (modern LLVM forbids
the `ConstantExpr` arithmetic that required); the verified Knuth primitive
(`core/KnuthHash`) remains available.
